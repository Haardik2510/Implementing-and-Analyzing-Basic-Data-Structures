# Implementing-and-Analyzing-Basic-Data-Structures
FOR THE FIRST SOLUTION OPEN IMPLEMENTINGARRAYS.CPP FILE AND RUN THE CODE IN VS CODE OR ANY OTHER IDE.
FOR THE SECOND SOLUTION OPEN 4X4.CPP FILE FOLLOWING THE SAME PROCESS
FOR THE THIRD SOLUTION OPENN ARITHMETICOPERATIONS.CPP 

HERE ARE THE THE ALGORITHM ANALYSIS FOR THE FOLLOWING 
Time Complexity:
1D Array:

Insertion: O(n) in the worst case (shifting elements).
Deletion: O(n) for shifting elements.
Traversal: O(n) for visiting each element.
2D Array:

Insertion: O(1) if indices are provided.
Deletion: O(1) for setting a value to 0.
Traversal: O(m * n), where m and n are the row and column dimensions.
Arithmetic Operations:

Row-wise Addition: O(n) for each row.
Cumulative Addition: O(m * n) for traversing the entire array.
Space Complexity:
1D Array: O(n) for storing n elements.
2D Array: O(m * n) for storing m rows and n columns.
